# My Introduction

Hello! My name is Chengjie Lu. I am currently a graduate student at Boston University pursuing a master’s degree in Business Analytics. I completed my undergraduate studies in Financial Mathematics at Hong Kong Baptist University. From a young age, I developed a strong passion for mathematics. One of my earliest memories involves my father teaching me the game "24 Points," which involves creatively combining four numbers using arithmetic operations to reach the value 24. I still enjoy playing this game in my free time, as it has sharpened my number sense and deepened my appreciation for mathematical reasoning.

In middle school, I competed twice in the National Mathematical Olympiad, earning two provincial gold medals and a national bronze. During high school, I scored 147 out of 150 on the mathematics section of China's Gaokao college entrance examination. At university, I systematically studied financial mathematics while also exploring the field of computer science. I participated in both the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM) and the China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling (CUMCM), continuously strengthening my computational and analytical skills.

Since joining Boston University, I have taken part in an internal hackathon during my first semester and frequently explore abstract mathematical problems on Project Euler to train my logical thinking. I take pride in being a diligent and resilient learner, with a strong sense of dedication. For example, during a volunteer data entry job involving repetitive and tedious tasks, I maintained a positive attitude, consistently exceeded performance targets, and remained courteous in professional interactions.

In addition, I am innovative and eager to apply knowledge to real-world contexts. After completing a C++ course during my sophomore year, I created a simple random name selector program for my cousin, a high school teacher, to use in her classroom. This small project gave me a sense of fulfillment and the joy of using what I’ve learned. Later, in a nature observation course, I developed a basic algorithm to identify the peak activity periods of bird species, improving our group's observation efficiency.

Finally, I am intellectually curious and often go beyond the standard requirements. During an internship at a securities firm, I was tasked with analyzing a financial product. While other teams focused primarily on public financial statements, I investigated investment objectives, strategies, and future outlooks, applying Monte Carlo simulations for data-driven analysis. This approach earned praise from my mentors and solidified my commitment to combining academic depth with practical innovation.
